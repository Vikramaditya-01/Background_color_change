# Background Color Changer

This is a simple web application that allows users to change the background color of the page by clicking on color buttons. It includes social media links in the top-left corner and a contact email button in the bottom-right corner. The social media icons and the email button's background color adjust dynamically to match the selected background color.

## Features

- Four color buttons (Grey, White, Blue, Yellow) that change the background color of the webpage when clicked.
- Social media links (LinkedIn, Twitter, GitHub) with logos that dynamically adjust their background to match the selected page color.
- A contact email button in the footer that also adjusts to the selected page color.
